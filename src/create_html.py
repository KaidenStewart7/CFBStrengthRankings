Each week, new rankings will be added. Early in the season, the main factor weighting the strength ratings will be their talent rating; however, as the season progresses and more games are played, each teamâ€™s rankings will factor in their \"resume rating\" more than their talent rating. Eventually, after each team plays 12 games against FBS opponents, their strength rating will be comprised only of their resume rating.
